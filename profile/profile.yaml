# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I am a graduate student at the University of Windsor in the final days of my program. I am pursuing a professional master's degree in Applied Computing. Before that, I interned first as a Microsoft Leap Apprentice and subsequently as a graduate intern at a software development and consulting firm. During this time, I collaborated with the software team to release features for a custody management system for a local bank. The diverse range of applications in different industries possible by applying software development principles is one of my favorite things about the industry. I also like that it is an ever-evolving field, so there is always something new to learn. I am currently with Jarvis to expand and gain new software and data engineering skills by working on various software projects using different languages and frameworks in an agile environment.
