Before that, I interned first as a Microsoft Leap Apprentice and subsequently as a graduate intern at a software development and consulting firm. During this time, I collaborated with the software team to release features for a custody management system for a local bank. The diverse range of applications in different industries possible by applying software development principles is one of my favorite things about the industry. I also like that it is an ever-evolving field, so there is always something new to learn. I am currently with Jarvis to expand and gain new software and data engineering skills by working on various software projects using different languages and frameworks in an agile environment."
